## For developers:

1. Follow the above set-up instructions for Windows / Linux

2. If you wish to manually battle agents over a number of iterations and observe their respective win rates, modify and run python main_experiments.py following the in-file comments

3. If you wish to experience how the human participants were tested in this project, run python human_test_main.py

If running the game does not work, try to run 'python3 main.py' instead
